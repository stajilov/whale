# What is WHALE?

- Multiagent Harness
- With looping capabilities
- With Ontologies and Knolwedgebase 


## Glossary 

*Agent AI Harnesss* - runtime for multiagent systems with orchestrations based on LLLM backbone.
*Loop Engineering*  - a method to work with AI agents in a loop conrolled way. Following the pattern: act → observe → decide → repeat with exit criteria
*Swarm* - multiple agents working in paralleing, executing a piece of instruction from the system or the user



## Specs
- exetensive memory, ideally it should have structured memory
- Should be able to launch swarms of agents
- Should have stop criteria
- It should be self-learning!
- Should have tools available, as many as possible
- Looping



## Architecture
(
1. pick up (remember what was before aka retrieve from memory)
2. learn (run a loop to have high level understanding what was before)
3. plan (run a loop to iterate over planning, this includes spinning up the agents to plan (a swarm), maybe! plan with tree like scruture, tree-like graph  ) 
4. research ( research further down to strengthen the plan, also with the swarm of agentic) 
5. Execucute the plan -> produce the output for the user, via swarm. 
6. Register the completition fact, save the output, match it to the plan from step 3.
7. Decide -> Provide the output

   GO LOOP OVER
) -> LOOP OVER


### Architecural aspects
- Multiagent
- Memory (semistructure), llm wiki type, Semantica  !
- Learning capabilities
- powerful on simple fast cheap LLM backbones
- Swarm capabilities ! 
- rhizomatic-like structure !

LOOP around with success criteria



### Worth mentioning
System Prompts
capability surface (skills, plugins, MCP, tools, platforms) 
Autodiscovery of tools, autocreation of skills etc (via hooks)
Bundled Infrastructure (filesystem, sandbox, browser)
Orchestration Logic (subagent spawning, handoffs, model routing)
Hooks/Middleware for deterministic execution (compaction, continuation, lint checks)
Agents and task survivoal `cronjob` or `terminal(background=True, notify_on_complete=True)`


## Form
- CLI - bundles
- UI Too


## Dev Tools
- VS Code
- Python + Typer OR Go + Cobra
- github
- github actions for CI/CD




- opencode + Miniimax M3
- kiloode
- Codex
- Claude Code
and other


## Design

CLI Tool


`whale`  continues session form the pwd  / execute a prompt
Availble commands:

-h --help
-m --models / LLM backbone
-s --sessions
-sk --skills add nameoftheskill/SKILL.md
-ag --agents add [AGENT]
-aa --apps add type: OAuth 
-mm --memory manage [forget | relearn | add ]

-cc --custom commands
--c -add  


## Config 
System folder + settings
json file (?)
~/.whale
skills
agents
-default
-custom
mcps
tool (loaded dynamically)
settings.json
apps
- oauth.json
- specs.jsom (can have OpenAPI)

memory -> mongo like, sql like (with a native tools to read from it)

sessions 
SessioId , MessageId, tools_called, content



## Important things
- Cheap to run
- Vast access to file system and tools
- Should complete the tasks efficiently
- Should have feedback loop



## Acceptance criteria
- Reliable harness with memoery and self-evolving capabilies
- Lean in token consumption
- Guranteed result to execute tasks and deliver


## Misc
landing page
wiki docs
native integrations: memory engines like openwolf
curl and brew installation, apt etc installations
